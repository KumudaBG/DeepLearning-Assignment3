**Assignment 3**

Generating data : 3 dimensions input and 2 dimensions output

a) Using pure Numpy to build a 3 layer neural network (with relu nonlinearity)

b.1) Using pure pytorch tensor datastructure to build the same without auto differentiation

b.2) Using the pure pytorch tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives

b.3 ) Using the pure pytorch linear modules- high level primitives and build neural network

c.1) Using pure tensorflow tensor datastructure to build the same without auto differentiation.

c.2) Using the pure tensorflow tensor data structure to build the same but with auto differentiation primitives

c.3 ) Using the pure tensorflow keras linear modules- high level primitives and build neural network
